# My current vim setup.

Currently only supporting Ubuntu. If you're interested in checking it out, clone it then run

```
~/.vim/bootstrap.sh
```

It might take a minute or two to check and install libs. Included are:

* Valloric/YouCompleteMe for autocompletion
* scrooloose/nerdTree for filesystem browsing
* scrooloose/nerdcommenter for language-agnostic commenting
* jiangmiao/auto-pairs for quickly discerning parenthesis/bracket pairs 
* terryma/vim-multiple-cursors for Sublime-style multiple cursor functionality

Maybe later I'll document the keybindings, but heyâ€”they're right in the vimrc.
